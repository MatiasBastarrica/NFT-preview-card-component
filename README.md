## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to use a pseudo-element to change the background and modify the content of the card on hover.

### Continued development

In the future I would like to keep practicing overlapping elements.

### Useful resources

- [order CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order) - This article helped me understand that this property can be used in both flexbox and grid layouts.
- [content CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) - I wanted to learn how to add an image to a pseudo-element, and this article helped me understand how to do that.
